# Contribution Guide

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Eomm's repositories on GitHub.

## Contribute

Any contribution is welcome in the form of:

- New features.
- Fixing typos.
- Improving docs.
- Triaging [issues](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=user:Eomm+is:issue+is:open&s=updated).
- Reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=user:Eomm+is:pr+is:open&s=updated).
- Sharing your opinion on issues.

## Issues

- Before opening a new issue, look for existing issues (even closed ones).
- If you're reporting a bug, include as much information as possible. Ideally, include a test case that reproduces the bug. For example, a [Runkit](https://runkit.com) or [repl.it](https://repl.it) playground.
- If you're not sure about adding something, open an issue to discuss it.

## Pull requests

### Submission

- Give the pull request a clear title and description. It's up to you to convince the maintainers why your changes should be merged.
- If the pull request fixes an issue, reference it in the pull request description using the syntax `Fixes #123`.
- Make sure the “Allow edits from maintainers” checkbox is checked. That way I can make certain minor changes myself, allowing your pull request to be merged sooner.

### Review

- Push new commits when doing changes to the pull request. Don't squash as it makes it hard to see what changed since the last review. I will squash when merging.
- It's better to present solutions than asking questions.
- Review the pull request diff after each new commit. It's better that you catch mistakes early than the maintainers pointing it out and having to go back and forth.
- Be patient. Maintainers often have a lot of pull requests to review. Feel free to bump the pull request if you haven't received a reply in a couple of weeks.
